# Primer Performance Benchmark

This project compares the performance of two prime number identification algorithms:

1. **Sieve of Atkin-like method**
2. **Brute-force checking method**

It utilizes NumPy for optimized list handling and measures execution time for a given range of numbers.

## Features
- Implements a **Sieve of Atkin-like** algorithm to filter prime numbers efficiently.
- Implements a **brute-force prime detection** approach.
- Compares execution times of both approaches.
- Uses emoji representations:
  - ðŸŸ¦ Prime numbers
  - ðŸŸ¥ Non-prime numbers

## Req
Ensure you have Python installed. This script uses **NumPy**, so install dependencies before running:

```sh
pip install numpy
```

## Run
Run the script using:

```sh
python primer.py
```
